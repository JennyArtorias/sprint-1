Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay-person(e.g your mum)

	The Command line lets you communicate directly with your computer and instruct it to perform various tasks. The commands are not necessarily intuitive. so they have to be learned, just like words in a language.

List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e with minimal technical jargon describe what they do)

	-git push -- Git takes a copy of your local tracked folder and updates your remote one

	-git init -- tells git to keep track of the current folder you are in

	-git config -- Short for configure. this is useful when your setting up git for the first time

	-git help -- If you forget a command you can type this into the command line to bring up the 21 most command git commands. You can also be more specific and type "git help init" or anotehr term to figure out how to use and configure a specific git command.

	-git status -- Check the status of your repository(Current folder you are tracking). See which files are iside it, which changes still need to be commited(snapshot/savepoint), and which branch of the repository you're currently working on

	-git add -- This does not add new files to your tracked folder(repository). Instead, it rings new files to Git's attention. After you add files, they're included in Git's "snapshots" fo the repository

	-git commit -- Gits most important command. After you make any sort of change, you input this in order to take a "snapshot" of the tracked folder(repository). Usually it goes git commit -m "XXXX"

	-git branch -- Allows you to work with multiple collaboratos and make changes on your own by making a copy of the original(master) branch. This command will let you build a new branch, or timeline of commits, of changes and files additions that are completely your own. Your name of branch goes after the command.

	-git checkout -- Literally allows you to "check out" a tracked folder(repository) that you are not currently inside. This is a navigatioal coand that lets you move to the tracked folder (repository) you want to check. 

	-git pull -- Git copys the remote repository(files/folder) and creates a local copy that is tracked.

	-ls -- lists the current files in the current folder
